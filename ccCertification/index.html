                <p class="lead"> Copyright can make sharing and collaboration illegal at times when sharing information in new ways might allow constructive criticism and growth. It was necessary to create Creative Commons "to help address the tension between the creator’s ability to share digital works globally and copyright regulation."<sup>1.</sup></p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>When the Sonny Bono Copyright term Extension Act (CTEA) extended copyright terms, Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford Law Professor, believed the changes to the law to be unconstitutional. The end of a work's copyright, and its movement into the public domain, is often the beginning of a new cycle of sharing and growth. Is restricting that growth and creativity by adding 20 years to the copyright term truly supported by the constitution? </p>

                <p>And so Lawrence Lessig represented a web publisher, Eric Eldred in an effort to challenge the constitutionality of the CTEA in a case known as Eldred v. Ashcroft. Even though they didn’t win the case, which went all the way to the
                Supreme Court, their efforts helped to define a need for new ways to make online sharing legal.</p>

                <p>Eldred's ideas about creating,remixing and sharing content became an inspiration for Lessig and others. They founded
                Creative Commons (CC), a nonprofit organization that offers new licenses with flexible terms. In time, CC has grown
                as an organization, as a set of licenses, and as a part of a movement. CC licenses work within copyright law to
                allow additional levels of sharing and collaboration: they change “all rights reserved” to “some rights reserved.”
                The licenses also stay current in a changing legal environment.</p>

                
                <p>As a legal tool that offers clear options and addresses an obvious need, Creative Commons licenses are often useful,
                and as long as technology continues to change faster than the laws that govern it, the need for new licenses will
                continue to grow. "In domains like textbook publishing, academic research, documentary film, and many more,
                restrictive copyright rules continue to inhibit creation, access, and remix. CC tools are helping to solve this
                problem."<sup>2.</sup></p>

                <blockquote><br><i>There are 6 main licenses currently available through Creative Commons to help people with different
                needs, and more than 1.6 billion works online across 9 million websites use Creative Commons licenses.</i><br><br>

                <p>Creative Commons has become a standard tool in a community of users who are interested in supporting sharing and
                collaboration. A movement is growing, and those who would like to get involved in the <a

                <p><b>The purpose of copyright <sup>2.</sup></b>&nbsp;The website <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/about/">copyright.gov</a>  explains that “Copyright is a form of protection grounded in the U.S. Constitution and granted by law for original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression.”<sup>3.</sup> The two primary rationales for
                copyright law, as described in the <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/">Creative Commons Certificate text</a> are Utilitarian and Author’s rights. While
                different countries have different approaches, most of them agree that authors have rights that should be protected.
                Now that so much written work is available online, it is even more important that creators are given credit for their
                work, can control how it is used, and can protect it from distortion. Copyright is usually applied automatically, once a
                work is fixed in a tangible medium.
                </p>
                <p><b>What is copyrightable and what is not.<sup>4.</sup></b>&nbsp; Different countries have agreed, in copyright treaties, that copyright applies to certain categories of works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Literary and artistic works</li>
                    <li>Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and alterations of literary and artistic works</li>
                    <li>Collections of literary and artistic works</li>
                    <li>And sometimes applied art and industrial designs and models, and computer software</li>
                </ul>            
                <p>Copyright law does not cover:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cultural and historical contexts must be considered. Some material may have community-specific restrictions.</li>
                    <li>U.S. government works are not protected by copyright law, and with only a few exceptions are considered to be public
                    domain.</li>
                </ul>
                        
                <p>A creator who controls an idea’s expression does not necessarily have exclusive control over the idea itself.</p>     
                
                <p><b>Copyright is one of many types of intellectual property.</b> <sup>5.</sup> &nbsp; Rights have been established by law, called intellectual property (IP) rights, that protect creators from those who
                would misuse their creative works. Copyright is one type of IP, along with trade secrets, publicity rights, and moral
                rights. Trademark law and patent law are particularly interesting.</p>

                <p>Trademark law is specific to producers of goods and services, who need to prevent the public from confusing their
                products with someone else’s. Symbols or specific brand names can help a company succeed in a competitive market, where
                loyalty and public trust must be earned.</p>
                <p>Patent law is particularly relevant to inventors, who profit from time-limited monopolies on their inventions. “Patents
                typically give inventors the exclusive right to make, have made, use, have used, offer for sale, sell, have sold, or
                import patentable inventions.”</p> 

                <p><b>How a person receives copyright protection for their work.<sup>6.</sup></b> &nbsp; In most countries, once a person takes an original idea and turns it into something tangible, copyright is automatically
                granted. Once words are written down, or songs are recorded, or, depending on the country, computer software is saved to
                a computer, copyright law protects the creator by granting certain exclusive rights. We also must not forget that users
                have certain rights of use, that are defined by copyright laws too.</p>

                <p>It is often a good idea to register your work, officially, with a local copyright authority. In some countries,
                registration might even be necessary in cases where your rights are challenged in some way and copyright laws must be
                enforced.</p>

                <p><b>The public domain<sup>7.</sup></b> &nbsp; The terms of the copyright protection of a creative work include its entry into the public domain, where it can become
                an asset to everyone, and part of our cultural heritage. A large, and growing number of works in the public domain can
                be freely copied, adapted, and shared.</p>

                <p>Works enter the public domain in one of four ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The copyright expires.</li>
                    <li>The work was never entitled to copyright protection.</li>
                    <li>The creator dedicates the work to the public domain before copyright has expired.</li>
                    <li>The copyright holder failed to comply with formalities to acquire or maintain their copyright.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Fair use or fair dealing.<sup>8.</sup></b> &nbsp; Copyright is not absolute, and if someone is using a copyrighted work within “fair” limitations, then they are not
                breaking the law. In the United States, we follow the fair use doctrine, and in many other common law countries, the
                fair dealing doctrine is followed. But what is fair?</p>

                <p>The Berne Convention established a “three-step” test in Article 9 section 2, which has been used in other treaties as
                well:</p>
                
                <blockquote><br><i>“It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain
                special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not
                unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. (emphasis supplied)”</i></blockquote>

                <p class="lead">Creative Commons Licenses are a great tool to allow creators with Copyright to make their work available to others, while setting clear limits. Users can reuse or share pictures, for instance, without worrying that they are breaking the law, as long as the terms of the Creative Commons License are followed. It’s just a matter of learning the rules!</p>

                <p><b>The Legal Code</b> &nbsp; Copyright laws can be complicated, so it makes sense that CC licenses would need some complex code to protect creators
                and inform users, while working with copyright laws. The legal code layer contains the “lawyer-readable” information
                legally enforceable in court.</p>

                <p><b>The Commons Deeds</b> &nbsp; The layer that most users rely on is called the Commons Deeds layer. It summarizes the legal code in a more “human-readable” way, that users can better understand. It doesn’t replace the legal license, which is always linked to
                the deeds.</p>

                <p><b>Machine Readable Version</b> &nbsp; CC licenses have a special relationship to digital sharing, and to make things easier for digital users, a “machine readable” version of the license was created. It summarizes the licenses in a way that works with software, including search engines.</p>

                <p><b>What is Open Access?</b> &nbsp;One definition of OA literature, offered by scholar Peter Suber, is that OA is digital, online, free of charge, and free
                of most copyright and licensing restrictions. <sup>1.</sup>
                
                The Budapest conference convened by the Open Society Institute helped form best practices that support the continued
                growth of OA.</p>

                <p>The Budapest Open Access Initiative defined open access as free “availability on the public internet, permitting any
                users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of [research] articles, crawl them
                for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or
                technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on
                reproduction and distribution and the only role for copyright in this domain should be to give authors control over the
                integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.”<sup>2.</sup></p>

                <p><b>OA is important for Faculty and Students </b><sup>3.</sup> &nbsp; Without Open Access, researchers secure grants, conduct experiments and collect data, then submit academic articles to
                journals, and eventually transfer copyright to publishers.
                With an Open Access (OA) approach, researchers still secure grants from government or private sources, but they commit
                to open access formats. This allows them to retain some or all rights to their research articles, which can be housed in
                their university’s institutional repository for long-term access or preservation, or published in OA journals.</p>

                <p><b>BY-NC-SA</b> &nbsp; Thanks to the OA movement, researchers have more flexibility in publishing their work, and faculty and students gain
                access to materials with licenses needed to allow users to benefit now and in the future. OA materials are high-quality,
                flexible in amazing ways, and are low-cost and easy to find.
                Teachers must always evaluate the material that they share with students, and since the OA movement is focused on
                sharing and collaboration, useful criteria to evaluate materials are readily available to help with that too.</p>

                <p><b>“Green” and “Gold” Open Access</b> <sup>4.</sup> &nbsp; Since rights are not surrendered by the author of OA research literature, they have choices in how to make their work
                available to the public. The most commonly selected are known as “Green” or “Gold” Open Access.
                Green OA = ​making a version of the manuscript freely available in a repository. This is also known as self-archiving.
                An example of green OA is a university research repository. OA repositories can be organized by discipline (e.g. arXiv
                for physics) or institution (e.g. Knowledge@UChicago for the University of Chicago).
                Gold OA = making the final version of the manuscript freely available immediately upon publication by the publisher,
                typically by publishing in an Open Access journal and making the article available under an open license. Typically,
                Open Access journals charge an Article Processing Charge (APC) when an author wishes to (a) publish an article online
                allowing for free public access and (b) retain the copyright to the article. APCs range from $0 to several thousand
                dollars per article. Read more about APCs at Wikipedia. An example of a gold OA journal is PLOS.</p>

                <p><b>Definitions of Open Educational Resources</b> &nbsp; Researchers who publish work online are not the only ones who benefit from better tools like the internet and increasing
                digital information access. Educators at all levels have also called for new ways to create and share educational
                materials.
                
                Technology, Open Access materials, and Creative Commons licenses make it simple for Open Educational Resources (OER) to
                be used, shared, and built upon by creators, legally and at no cost, allowing educators to offer better support to more
                students.
                
                Or, to use Creative Commons’ adaptation of the UNESCO definition: “Open Educational Resources (OER) are: teaching,
                learning and research materials in any medium that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open
                license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others.”<sup>5.</sup></p>

                <p><b>5R Activities for Open Educational Resources</b> <sup>6.</sup> &nbsp;David Wiley defined a useful set of rules commonly used to determine if educational materials can be considered OER,
                called the 5Rs:
                
                Retain – permission to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
                Reuse – permission to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a
                video)
                Revise – permission to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another
                language)
                Remix – permission to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g.,
                incorporate the content into a mashup)
                Redistribute – permission to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g.,
                give a copy of to a friend) </p>
                <p><b>The relationship between OA and OER</b> &nbsp; Open Access (OA)policies support researchers, who keep their copyright, and can apply licenses that allow their work to
                become Open Educational Resources (OER).
                Repeatable results are important in the research community, and the fact that research data can be shared along with the
                article in an OA publication, can be important to researchers. If an OA work is shared as an OER with a Creative Commons
                license, then text and data mining are allowed (non-ND licenses, and CC BY is preferred).
                Joining the OA community also exposes authors to helpful resources like the Termination of Transfer tool, which gives
                authors information about their publication rights.</p>
                <p> The OER movement promotes OA works that are free to use, and licensed through Creative Commons so that users have legal
                permission to engage in 5R activities: Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix and Redistribute. “Open education is an idea, a set
                of content, practices, policy, and community which, properly leveraged, can help everyone in the world access free,
                effective, open learning materials for the marginal cost of zero.” <sup>7.</sup>
                Students benefit from peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and other publications that might be published under
                open-access terms in a journal or housed as Open Educational Resources in their university’s Institutional Repository.</p>
                <p><b>OER are important for Faculty and Students </b><sup>8.</sup> &nbsp;OER materials are freely available worldwide, and come in all shapes and sizes. The legal clarity provided by CC
                licenses has been a great help to Faculty and Students who want to confirm that their resources are “open.” Some
                examples of OER sources are: OpenStax, the Open Textbook Library or the BC Open Textbook Project.
                OER education materials can be freely downloaded, edited, and shared to better serve all students. If faculty needs OER
                courseware, that’s available too, at pages like the Open Education Consortium and MIT OCW. </p>
                <p>Institutions may purchase or subscribe to materials for their libraries, but they should consider that users save money
                and have better outcomes with OER than when they use materials under all rights reserved copyright.
                Teachers and professors in Higher Ed and in Primary/Secondary (K-12) currently blend all-rights-reserved commercial
                content, free library resources and OER, but more and more, OER is proving to be the popular alternative for all levels
                of education. </p>
                <p><b>Access to Open Education Materials</b> &nbsp; Creative Commons has made it possible for creators to legally share their content and empower its usefulness and growth.
                It now falls to the creators to use the tools that are available. Open Education materials have the potential to help
                people all over the world at near-zero cost, as long as work is licensed with sharing in mind.
                One tool that serves as a great example of a best-practice is LibGuides. Over 5,000 institutions in the United States
                use LibGuides as their preferred subject guide content management system, with over 120,000 license holders around the
                world. <sup>9.</sup></p>
                <p>Creative Commons is always working to do their part to support OA and OER, and their tools make things simple for
                creators who want to share their work. The License Chooser, for instance, can be used to create a machine-readable
                button for sites or LibGuides, and the Creative Commons Directory is a useful list of platforms popular with educators.
                If content is readily available, then it will be used and shared. Users will become creators and join the cycle.
                Everybody wins!</p>
