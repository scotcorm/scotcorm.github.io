<pre><span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;For neatly implementing static typing in packaging. 
 
`mypy` - the static type analysis tool we use - uses the `typing` module, which 
provides core functionality fundamental to mypy's functioning. 
 
Generally, `typing` would be imported at runtime and used in that fashion - 
it acts as a no-op at runtime and does not have any run-time overhead by 
design. 
 
As it turns out, `typing` is not vendorable - it uses separate sources for 
Python 2/Python 3. Thus, this codebase can not expect it to be present. 
To work around this, mypy allows the typing import to be behind a False-y 
optional to prevent it from running at runtime and type-comments can be used 
to remove the need for the types to be accessible directly during runtime. 
 
This module provides the False-y guard in a nicely named fashion so that a 
curious maintainer can reach here to read this. 
 
In packaging, all static-typing related imports should be guarded as follows: 
 
    from packaging._typing import TYPE_CHECKING 
 
    if TYPE_CHECKING: 
        from typing import ...
