            angle 
                Sets the angle (in degrees) from which the 
                radial axis is drawn. Note that by default, 
                radial axis line on the theta=0 line 
                corresponds to a line pointing right (like what 
                mathematicians prefer). Defaults to the first 
                `polar.sector` angle. 
            autorange 
                Determines whether or not the range of this 
                axis is computed in relation to the input data. 
                See `rangemode` for more info. If `range` is 
                provided, then `autorange` is set to False. 
            autotypenumbers 
                Using &quot;strict&quot; a numeric string in trace data 
                is not converted to a number. Using *convert 
                types* a numeric string in trace data may be 
                treated as a number during automatic axis 
                `type` detection. Defaults to 
                layout.autotypenumbers. 
            calendar 
                Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and 
                `tick0` if this is a date axis. This does not 
                set the calendar for interpreting data on this 
                axis, that's specified in the trace or via the 
                global `layout.calendar` 
            categoryarray 
                Sets the order in which categories on this axis 
                appear. Only has an effect if `categoryorder` 
                is set to &quot;array&quot;. Used with `categoryorder`. 
            categoryarraysrc 
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud 
                for `categoryarray`. 
            categoryorder 
                Specifies the ordering logic for the case of 
                categorical variables. By default, plotly uses 
                &quot;trace&quot;, which specifies the order that is 
                present in the data supplied. Set 
                `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or 
                *category descending* if order should be 
                determined by the alphanumerical order of the 
                category names. Set `categoryorder` to &quot;array&quot; 
                to derive the ordering from the attribute 
                `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in 
                the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior 
                for that attribute will be identical to the 
                &quot;trace&quot; mode. The unspecified categories will 
                follow the categories in `categoryarray`. Set 
                `categoryorder` to *total ascending* or *total 
                descending* if order should be determined by 
                the numerical order of the values. Similarly, 
                the order can be determined by the min, max, 
                sum, mean or median of all the values. 
            color 
                Sets default for all colors associated with 
                this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and 
                grid colors. Grid color is lightened by 
                blending this with the plot background 
                Individual pieces can override this. 
            dtick 
                Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. 
                Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or 
                special strings available to &quot;log&quot; and &quot;date&quot; 
                axes. If the axis `type` is &quot;log&quot;, then ticks 
                are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick 
                number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 
                10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick 
                marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To 
                set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... 
                set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. &quot;log&quot; 
                has several special values; &quot;L&lt;f&gt;&quot;, where `f` 
                is a positive number, gives ticks linearly 
                spaced in value (but not position). For example 
                `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = &quot;L0.5&quot; will put ticks 
                at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 
                plus small digits between, use &quot;D1&quot; (all 
                digits) or &quot;D2&quot; (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is 
                ignored for &quot;D1&quot; and &quot;D2&quot;. If the axis `type` 
                is &quot;date&quot;, then you must convert the time to 
                milliseconds. For example, to set the interval 
                between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 
                86400000.0. &quot;date&quot; also has special values 
                &quot;M&lt;n&gt;&quot; gives ticks spaced by a number of 
                months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set 
                ticks on the 15th of every third month, set 
                `tick0` to &quot;2000-01-15&quot; and `dtick` to &quot;M3&quot;. To 
                set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to &quot;M48&quot; 
            exponentformat 
                Determines a formatting rule for the tick 
                exponents. For example, consider the number 
                1,000,000,000. If &quot;none&quot;, it appears as 
                1,000,000,000. If &quot;e&quot;, 1e+9. If &quot;E&quot;, 1E+9. If 
                &quot;power&quot;, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If 
                &quot;SI&quot;, 1G. If &quot;B&quot;, 1B. 
            gridcolor 
                Sets the color of the grid lines. 
            gridwidth 
                Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. 
            hoverformat 
                Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 
                formatting mini-languages which are very 
                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h 
                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-f 
                ormat. And for dates see: 
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time- 
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two 
                items to d3's date formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of 
                the year as a decimal number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; 
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For 
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with 
                tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display 
                &quot;09~15~23.46&quot; 
            layer 
                Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. 
                If *above traces*, this axis is displayed above 
                all the subplot's traces If *below traces*, 
                this axis is displayed below all the subplot's 
                traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when 
                used together with scatter-like traces with 
                `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers 
                and/or text nodes above this axis. 
            linecolor 
                Sets the axis line color. 
            linewidth 
                Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. 
            minexponent 
                Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this 
                number. This only has an effect when 
                `tickformat` is &quot;SI&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. 
            nticks 
                Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the 
                particular axis. The actual number of ticks 
                will be chosen automatically to be less than or 
                equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if 
                `tickmode` is set to &quot;auto&quot;. 
            range 
                Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` 
                is &quot;log&quot;, then you must take the log of your 
                desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 
                100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis 
                `type` is &quot;date&quot;, it should be date strings, 
                like date data, though Date objects and unix 
                milliseconds will be accepted and converted to 
                strings. If the axis `type` is &quot;category&quot;, it 
                should be numbers, using the scale where each 
                category is assigned a serial number from zero 
                in the order it appears. 
            rangemode 
                If *tozero*`, the range extends to 0, 
                regardless of the input data If &quot;nonnegative&quot;, 
                the range is non-negative, regardless of the 
                input data. If &quot;normal&quot;, the range is computed 
                in relation to the extrema of the input data 
                (same behavior as for cartesian axes). 
            separatethousands 
                If &quot;true&quot;, even 4-digit integers are separated 
            showexponent 
                If &quot;all&quot;, all exponents are shown besides their 
                significands. If &quot;first&quot;, only the exponent of 
                the first tick is shown. If &quot;last&quot;, only the 
                exponent of the last tick is shown. If &quot;none&quot;, 
                no exponents appear. 
            showgrid 
                Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. 
                If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick 
                mark. 
            showline 
                Determines whether or not a line bounding this 
                axis is drawn. 
            showticklabels 
                Determines whether or not the tick labels are 
                drawn. 
            showtickprefix 
                If &quot;all&quot;, all tick labels are displayed with a 
                prefix. If &quot;first&quot;, only the first tick is 
                displayed with a prefix. If &quot;last&quot;, only the 
                last tick is displayed with a suffix. If 
                &quot;none&quot;, tick prefixes are hidden. 
            showticksuffix 
                Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes. 
            side 
                Determines on which side of radial axis line 
                the tick and tick labels appear. 
            tick0 
                Sets the placement of the first tick on this 
                axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is 
                &quot;log&quot;, then you must take the log of your 
                starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 
                100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when 
                `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If 
                the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;, it should be a date 
                string, like date data. If the axis `type` is 
                &quot;category&quot;, it should be a number, using the 
                scale where each category is assigned a serial 
                number from zero in the order it appears. 
            tickangle 
                Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect 
                to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` 
                of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. 
            tickcolor 
                Sets the tick color. 
            tickfont 
                Sets the tick font. 
            tickformat 
                Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 
                formatting mini-languages which are very 
                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h 
                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-f 
                ormat. And for dates see: 
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time- 
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two 
                items to d3's date formatter: &quot;%h&quot; for half of 
                the year as a decimal number as well as &quot;%{n}f&quot; 
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For 
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with 
                tickformat &quot;%H~%M~%S.%2f&quot; would display 
                &quot;09~15~23.46&quot; 
            tickformatstops 
                A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout. 
                polar.radialaxis.Tickformatstop` instances or 
                dicts with compatible properties 
            tickformatstopdefaults 
                When used in a template (as layout.template.lay 
                out.polar.radialaxis.tickformatstopdefaults), 
                sets the default property values to use for 
                elements of 
                layout.polar.radialaxis.tickformatstops 
            ticklen 
                Sets the tick length (in px). 
            tickmode 
                Sets the tick mode for this axis. If &quot;auto&quot;, 
                the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If 
                &quot;linear&quot;, the placement of the ticks is 
                determined by a starting position `tick0` and a 
                tick step `dtick` (&quot;linear&quot; is the default 
                value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If 
                &quot;array&quot;, the placement of the ticks is set via 
                `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. 
                (&quot;array&quot; is the default value if `tickvals` is 
                provided). 
            tickprefix 
                Sets a tick label prefix. 
            ticks 
                Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If 
                &quot;&quot;, this axis' ticks are not drawn. If 
                &quot;outside&quot; (&quot;inside&quot;), this axis' are drawn 
                outside (inside) the axis lines. 
            ticksuffix 
                Sets a tick label suffix. 
            ticktext 
                Sets the text displayed at the ticks position 
                via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if 
                `tickmode` is set to &quot;array&quot;. Used with 
                `tickvals`. 
            ticktextsrc 
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud 
                for `ticktext`. 
            tickvals 
                Sets the values at which ticks on this axis 
                appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set 
                to &quot;array&quot;. Used with `ticktext`. 
            tickvalssrc 
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud 
                for `tickvals`.
