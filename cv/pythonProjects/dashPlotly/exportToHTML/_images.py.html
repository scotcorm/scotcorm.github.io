            layer 
                Specifies whether images are drawn below or 
                above traces. When `xref` and `yref` are both 
                set to `paper`, image is drawn below the entire 
                plot area. 
            name 
                When used in a template, named items are 
                created in the output figure in addition to any 
                items the figure already has in this array. You 
                can modify these items in the output figure by 
                making your own item with `templateitemname` 
                matching this `name` alongside your 
                modifications (including `visible: false` or 
                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect 
                outside of a template. 
            opacity 
                Sets the opacity of the image. 
            sizex 
                Sets the image container size horizontally. The 
                image will be sized based on the `position` 
                value. When `xref` is set to `paper`, units are 
                sized relative to the plot width. When `xref` 
                ends with ` domain`, units are sized relative 
                to the axis width. 
            sizey 
                Sets the image container size vertically. The 
                image will be sized based on the `position` 
                value. When `yref` is set to `paper`, units are 
                sized relative to the plot height. When `yref` 
                ends with ` domain`, units are sized relative 
                to the axis height. 
            sizing 
                Specifies which dimension of the image to 
                constrain. 
            source 
                Specifies the URL of the image to be used. The 
                URL must be accessible from the domain where 
                the plot code is run, and can be either 
                relative or absolute. 
            templateitemname 
                Used to refer to a named item in this array in 
                the template. Named items from the template 
                will be created even without a matching item in 
                the input figure, but you can modify one by 
                making an item with `templateitemname` matching 
                its `name`, alongside your modifications 
                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false` 
                to hide it). If there is no template or no 
                matching item, this item will be hidden unless 
                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`. 
            visible 
                Determines whether or not this image is 
                visible. 
            x 
                Sets the image's x position. When `xref` is set 
                to `paper`, units are sized relative to the 
                plot height. See `xref` for more info 
            xanchor 
                Sets the anchor for the x position 
            xref 
                Sets the images's x coordinate axis. If set to 
                a x axis id (e.g. &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x2&quot;), the `x` 
                position refers to a x coordinate. If set to 
                &quot;paper&quot;, the `x` position refers to the 
                distance from the left of the plotting area in 
                normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds 
                to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID 
                followed by &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), 
                the position behaves like for &quot;paper&quot;, but 
                refers to the distance in fractions of the 
                domain length from the left of the domain of 
                that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the 
                domain of the second x  axis and a x position 
                of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and 
                the right of the domain of the second x axis. 
            y 
                Sets the image's y position. When `yref` is set 
                to `paper`, units are sized relative to the 
                plot height. See `yref` for more info 
            yanchor 
                Sets the anchor for the y position. 
            yref 
                Sets the images's y coordinate axis. If set to 
                a y axis id (e.g. &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y2&quot;), the `y` 
                position refers to a y coordinate. If set to 
                &quot;paper&quot;, the `y` position refers to the 
                distance from the bottom of the plotting area 
                in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) 
                corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y 
                axis ID followed by &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a 
                space), the position behaves like for &quot;paper&quot;, 
                but refers to the distance in fractions of the 
                domain length from the bottom of the domain of 
                that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the 
                domain of the second y  axis and a y position 
                of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom 
                and the top of the domain of the second y axis.
