<pre><span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
Decorators for labeling and modifying behavior of test objects. 
 
Decorators that merely return a modified version of the original 
function object are straightforward. Decorators that return a new 
function object need to use 
:: 
 
  nose.tools.make_decorator(original_function)(decorator) 
 
in returning the decorator, in order to preserve meta-data such as 
function name, setup and teardown functions and so on - see 
``nose.tools`` for more information.

    Label a test as 'slow'. 
 
    The exact definition of a slow test is obviously both subjective and 
    hardware-dependent, but in general any individual test that requires more 
    than a second or two should be labeled as slow (the whole suite consists of 
    thousands of tests, so even a second is significant). 
 
    Parameters 
    ---------- 
    t : callable 
        The test to label as slow. 
 
    Returns 
    ------- 
    t : callable 
        The decorated test `t`. 
 
    Examples 
    -------- 
    The `numpy.testing` module includes ``import decorators as dec``. 
    A test can be decorated as slow like this:: 
 
      from numpy.testing import * 
 
      @dec.slow 
      def test_big(self): 
          print('Big, slow test')

    Signals to nose that this function is or is not a test. 
 
    Parameters 
    ---------- 
    tf : bool 
        If True, specifies that the decorated callable is a test. 
        If False, specifies that the decorated callable is not a test. 
        Default is True. 
 
    Notes 
    ----- 
    This decorator can't use the nose namespace, because it can be 
    called from a non-test module. See also ``istest`` and ``nottest`` in 
    ``nose.tools``. 
 
    Examples 
    -------- 
    `setastest` can be used in the following way:: 
 
      from numpy.testing import dec 
 
      @dec.setastest(False) 
      def func_with_test_in_name(arg1, arg2): 
          pass

    Make function raise SkipTest exception if a given condition is true. 
 
    If the condition is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically 
    make the decision. This is useful for tests that may require costly 
    imports, to delay the cost until the test suite is actually executed. 
 
    Parameters 
    ---------- 
    skip_condition : bool or callable 
        Flag to determine whether to skip the decorated test. 
    msg : str, optional 
        Message to give on raising a SkipTest exception. Default is None. 
 
    Returns 
    ------- 
    decorator : function 
        Decorator which, when applied to a function, causes SkipTest 
        to be raised when `skip_condition` is True, and the function 
        to be called normally otherwise. 
 
    Notes 
    ----- 
    The decorator itself is decorated with the ``nose.tools.make_decorator`` 
    function in order to transmit function name, and various other metadata.
