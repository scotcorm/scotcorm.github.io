            editable 
                Determines whether the shape could be activated 
                for edit or not. Has no effect when the older 
                editable shapes mode is enabled via 
                `config.editable` or 
                `config.edits.shapePosition`. 
            fillcolor 
                Sets the color filling the shape's interior. 
                Only applies to closed shapes. 
            fillrule 
                Determines which regions of complex paths 
                constitute the interior. For more info please 
                visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en- 
                US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule 
            layer 
                Specifies whether shapes are drawn below or 
                above traces. 
            line 
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.shape.Line` 
                instance or dict with compatible properties 
            name 
                When used in a template, named items are 
                created in the output figure in addition to any 
                items the figure already has in this array. You 
                can modify these items in the output figure by 
                making your own item with `templateitemname` 
                matching this `name` alongside your 
                modifications (including `visible: false` or 
                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect 
                outside of a template. 
            opacity 
                Sets the opacity of the shape. 
            path 
                For `type` &quot;path&quot; - a valid SVG path with the 
                pixel values replaced by data values in 
                `xsizemode`/`ysizemode` being &quot;scaled&quot; and 
                taken unmodified as pixels relative to 
                `xanchor` and `yanchor` in case of &quot;pixel&quot; size 
                mode. There are a few restrictions / quirks 
                only absolute instructions, not relative. So 
                the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q, C, T, 
                S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because 
                radius rx and ry are relative. In the future we 
                could consider supporting relative commands, 
                but we would have to decide on how to handle 
                date and log axes. Note that even as is, Q and 
                C Bezier paths that are smooth on linear axes 
                may not be smooth on log, and vice versa. no 
                chained &quot;polybezier&quot; commands - specify the 
                segment type for each one. On category axes, 
                values are numbers scaled to the serial numbers 
                of categories because using the categories 
                themselves there would be no way to describe 
                fractional positions On data axes: because 
                space and T are both normal components of path 
                strings, we can't use either to separate date 
                from time parts. Therefore we'll use underscore 
                for this purpose: 2015-02-21_13:45:56.789 
            templateitemname 
                Used to refer to a named item in this array in 
                the template. Named items from the template 
                will be created even without a matching item in 
                the input figure, but you can modify one by 
                making an item with `templateitemname` matching 
                its `name`, alongside your modifications 
                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false` 
                to hide it). If there is no template or no 
                matching item, this item will be hidden unless 
                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`. 
            type 
                Specifies the shape type to be drawn. If 
                &quot;line&quot;, a line is drawn from (`x0`,`y0`) to 
                (`x1`,`y1`) with respect to the axes' sizing 
                mode. If &quot;circle&quot;, a circle is drawn from 
                ((`x0`+`x1`)/2, (`y0`+`y1`)/2)) with radius 
                (|(`x0`+`x1`)/2 - `x0`|, |(`y0`+`y1`)/2 
                -`y0`)|) with respect to the axes' sizing mode. 
                If &quot;rect&quot;, a rectangle is drawn linking 
                (`x0`,`y0`), (`x1`,`y0`), (`x1`,`y1`), 
                (`x0`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y0`) with respect to the 
                axes' sizing mode. If &quot;path&quot;, draw a custom SVG 
                path using `path`. with respect to the axes' 
                sizing mode. 
            visible 
                Determines whether or not this shape is 
                visible. 
            x0 
                Sets the shape's starting x position. See 
                `type` and `xsizemode` for more info. 
            x1 
                Sets the shape's end x position. See `type` and 
                `xsizemode` for more info. 
            xanchor 
                Only relevant in conjunction with `xsizemode` 
                set to &quot;pixel&quot;. Specifies the anchor point on 
                the x axis to which `x0`, `x1` and x 
                coordinates within `path` are relative to. E.g. 
                useful to attach a pixel sized shape to a 
                certain data value. No effect when `xsizemode` 
                not set to &quot;pixel&quot;. 
            xref 
                Sets the shape's x coordinate axis. If set to a 
                x axis id (e.g. &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x2&quot;), the `x` position 
                refers to a x coordinate. If set to &quot;paper&quot;, 
                the `x` position refers to the distance from 
                the left of the plotting area in normalized 
                coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the left 
                (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by 
                &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a space), the position 
                behaves like for &quot;paper&quot;, but refers to the 
                distance in fractions of the domain length from 
                the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 
                domain* refers to the domain of the second x 
                axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the 
                point between the left and the right of the 
                domain of the second x axis. If the axis `type` 
                is &quot;log&quot;, then you must take the log of your 
                desired range. If the axis `type` is &quot;date&quot;, 
                then you must convert the date to unix time in 
                milliseconds. 
            xsizemode 
                Sets the shapes's sizing mode along the x axis. 
                If set to &quot;scaled&quot;, `x0`, `x1` and x 
                coordinates within `path` refer to data values 
                on the x axis or a fraction of the plot area's 
                width (`xref` set to &quot;paper&quot;). If set to 
                &quot;pixel&quot;, `xanchor` specifies the x position in 
                terms of data or plot fraction but `x0`, `x1` 
                and x coordinates within `path` are pixels 
                relative to `xanchor`. This way, the shape can 
                have a fixed width while maintaining a position 
                relative to data or plot fraction. 
            y0 
                Sets the shape's starting y position. See 
                `type` and `ysizemode` for more info. 
            y1 
                Sets the shape's end y position. See `type` and 
                `ysizemode` for more info. 
            yanchor 
                Only relevant in conjunction with `ysizemode` 
                set to &quot;pixel&quot;. Specifies the anchor point on 
                the y axis to which `y0`, `y1` and y 
                coordinates within `path` are relative to. E.g. 
                useful to attach a pixel sized shape to a 
                certain data value. No effect when `ysizemode` 
                not set to &quot;pixel&quot;. 
            yref 
                Sets the annotation's y coordinate axis. If set 
                to a y axis id (e.g. &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y2&quot;), the `y` 
                position refers to a y coordinate. If set to 
                &quot;paper&quot;, the `y` position refers to the 
                distance from the bottom of the plotting area 
                in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) 
                corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y 
                axis ID followed by &quot;domain&quot; (separated by a 
                space), the position behaves like for &quot;paper&quot;, 
                but refers to the distance in fractions of the 
                domain length from the bottom of the domain of 
                that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the 
                domain of the second y  axis and a y position 
                of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom 
                and the top of the domain of the second y axis. 
            ysizemode 
                Sets the shapes's sizing mode along the y axis. 
                If set to &quot;scaled&quot;, `y0`, `y1` and y 
                coordinates within `path` refer to data values 
                on the y axis or a fraction of the plot area's 
                height (`yref` set to &quot;paper&quot;). If set to 
                &quot;pixel&quot;, `yanchor` specifies the y position in 
                terms of data or plot fraction but `y0`, `y1` 
                and y coordinates within `path` are pixels 
                relative to `yanchor`. This way, the shape can 
                have a fixed height while maintaining a 
                position relative to data or plot fraction.
