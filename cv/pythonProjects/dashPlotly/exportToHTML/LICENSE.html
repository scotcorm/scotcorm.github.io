  <span class="s0">&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object</span>

  <span class="s0">editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications</span>
  <span class="s0">represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes</span>
  <span class="s0">of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain</span>
  <span class="s0">separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,</span>
  <span class="s0">the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including</span>
  <span class="s0">the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions</span>
  <span class="s0">to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally</span>

  <span class="s0">and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the</span>

  <span class="s0">excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise</span>
  <span class="s0">designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity</span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
  <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
  <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
  <span class="s0">copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</span>
  <span class="s0">publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</span>
  <span class="s0">Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
  <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
  <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
  <span class="s0">(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</span>
  <span class="s0">use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</span>

  <span class="s0">Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
  <span class="s0">with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
  <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
  <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
  <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
  <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
  <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
  <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
  <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
  <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
  <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

  <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
      <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

  <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
      <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

  <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
      <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
      <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
      <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
      <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

  <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
      <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
      <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
      <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
      <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
      <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
      <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
      <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
      <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
      <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
      <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
      <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
      <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
      <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
      <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
      <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
  <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
  <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
  <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
  <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
  <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
  <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
  <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
  <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
  <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
  <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
  <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
  <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
  <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
  <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
  <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
  <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
  <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
  <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
  <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
  <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
  <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
  <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
  <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
  <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
  <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
  <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
  <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
  <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
  <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
  <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
  <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
  <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
  <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
  <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
  <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
  <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
  <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
  <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
  <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
  <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
  <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>
