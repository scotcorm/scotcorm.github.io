        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Produce a sort key for given requirement based on preference. 
 
        The preference is defined as &quot;I think this requirement should be 
        resolved first&quot;. The lower the return value is, the more preferred 
        this group of arguments is. 
 
        :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. This 
            identifies the dependency matches of which should be returned. 
        :param resolutions: Mapping of candidates currently pinned by the 
            resolver. Each key is an identifier, and the value a candidate. 
            The candidate may conflict with requirements from ``information``. 
        :param candidates: Mapping of each dependency's possible candidates. 
            Each value is an iterator of candidates. 
        :param information: Mapping of requirement information of each package. 
            Each value is an iterator of *requirement information*. 
        :param backtrack_causes: Sequence of requirement information that were 
            the requirements that caused the resolver to most recently backtrack. 
 
        A *requirement information* instance is a named tuple with two members: 
 
        * ``requirement`` specifies a requirement contributing to the current 
          list of candidates. 
        * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (dependend on) the 
          requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement. 
 
        The preference could depend on a various of issues, including (not 
        necessarily in this order): 
 
        * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result? 
        * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be 
          worked on first? (I don't know, actually.) 
        * How many possibilities are there to satisfy this requirement? Those 
          with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess? 
        * Are there any known conflicts for this requirement? We should 
          probably work on those with the most known conflicts. 
 
        A sortable value should be returned (this will be used as the ``key`` 
        parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is, 
        the more preferred this requirement is (i.e. the sorting function 
        is called with ``reverse=False``).

        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Find all possible candidates that satisfy given constraints. 
 
        :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. This 
            identifies the dependency matches of which should be returned. 
        :param requirements: A mapping of requirements that all returned 
            candidates must satisfy. Each key is an identifier, and the value 
            an iterator of requirements for that dependency. 
        :param incompatibilities: A mapping of known incompatibilities of 
            each dependency. Each key is an identifier, and the value an 
            iterator of incompatibilities known to the resolver. All 
            incompatibilities *must* be excluded from the return value. 
 
        This should try to get candidates based on the requirements' types. 
        For VCS, local, and archive requirements, the one-and-only match is 
        returned, and for a &quot;named&quot; requirement, the index(es) should be 
        consulted to find concrete candidates for this requirement. 
 
        The return value should produce candidates ordered by preference; the 
        most preferred candidate should come first. The return type may be one 
        of the following: 
 
        * A callable that returns an iterator that yields candidates. 
        * An collection of candidates. 
        * An iterable of candidates. This will be consumed immediately into a 
          list of candidates.
