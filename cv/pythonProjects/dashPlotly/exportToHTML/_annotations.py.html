            align 
                Sets the horizontal alignment of the `text` 
                within the box. Has an effect only if `text` 
                spans two or more lines (i.e. `text` contains 
                one or more &lt;br&gt; HTML tags) or if an explicit 
                width is set to override the text width. 
            arrowcolor 
                Sets the color of the annotation arrow. 
            arrowhead 
                Sets the end annotation arrow head style. 
            arrowside 
                Sets the annotation arrow head position. 
            arrowsize 
                Sets the size of the end annotation arrow head, 
                relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1 
                (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the 
                line. 
            arrowwidth 
                Sets the width (in px) of annotation arrow 
                line. 
            ax 
                Sets the x component of the arrow tail about 
                the arrow head (in pixels). 
            ay 
                Sets the y component of the arrow tail about 
                the arrow head (in pixels). 
            bgcolor 
                Sets the background color of the annotation. 
            bordercolor 
                Sets the color of the border enclosing the 
                annotation `text`. 
            borderpad 
                Sets the padding (in px) between the `text` and 
                the enclosing border. 
            borderwidth 
                Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing 
                the annotation `text`. 
            captureevents 
                Determines whether the annotation text box 
                captures mouse move and click events, or allows 
                those events to pass through to data points in 
                the plot that may be behind the annotation. By 
                default `captureevents` is False unless 
                `hovertext` is provided. If you use the event 
                `plotly_clickannotation` without `hovertext` 
                you must explicitly enable `captureevents`. 
            font 
                Sets the annotation text font. 
            height 
                Sets an explicit height for the text box. null 
                (default) lets the text set the box height. 
                Taller text will be clipped. 
            hoverlabel 
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.scene.annot 
                ation.Hoverlabel` instance or dict with 
                compatible properties 
            hovertext 
                Sets text to appear when hovering over this 
                annotation. If omitted or blank, no hover label 
                will appear. 
            name 
                When used in a template, named items are 
                created in the output figure in addition to any 
                items the figure already has in this array. You 
                can modify these items in the output figure by 
                making your own item with `templateitemname` 
                matching this `name` alongside your 
                modifications (including `visible: false` or 
                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect 
                outside of a template. 
            opacity 
                Sets the opacity of the annotation (text + 
                arrow). 
            showarrow 
                Determines whether or not the annotation is 
                drawn with an arrow. If True, `text` is placed 
                near the arrow's tail. If False, `text` lines 
                up with the `x` and `y` provided. 
            standoff 
                Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end 
                arrowhead away from the position it is pointing 
                at, for example to point at the edge of a 
                marker independent of zoom. Note that this 
                shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay` vector, 
                in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves 
                everything by this amount. 
            startarrowhead 
                Sets the start annotation arrow head style. 
            startarrowsize 
                Sets the size of the start annotation arrow 
                head, relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1 
                (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the 
                line. 
            startstandoff 
                Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the start 
                arrowhead away from the position it is pointing 
                at, for example to point at the edge of a 
                marker independent of zoom. Note that this 
                shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay` vector, 
                in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves 
                everything by this amount. 
            templateitemname 
                Used to refer to a named item in this array in 
                the template. Named items from the template 
                will be created even without a matching item in 
                the input figure, but you can modify one by 
                making an item with `templateitemname` matching 
                its `name`, alongside your modifications 
                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false` 
                to hide it). If there is no template or no 
                matching item, this item will be hidden unless 
                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`. 
            text 
                Sets the text associated with this annotation. 
                Plotly uses a subset of HTML tags to do things 
                like newline (&lt;br&gt;), bold (&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;), italics 
                (&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), hyperlinks (&lt;a href='...'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). 
                Tags &lt;em&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;, &lt;sub&gt; &lt;span&gt; are also 
                supported. 
            textangle 
                Sets the angle at which the `text` is drawn 
                with respect to the horizontal. 
            valign 
                Sets the vertical alignment of the `text` 
                within the box. Has an effect only if an 
                explicit height is set to override the text 
                height. 
            visible 
                Determines whether or not this annotation is 
                visible. 
            width 
                Sets an explicit width for the text box. null 
                (default) lets the text set the box width. 
                Wider text will be clipped. There is no 
                automatic wrapping; use &lt;br&gt; to start a new 
                line. 
            x 
                Sets the annotation's x position. 
            xanchor 
                Sets the text box's horizontal position anchor 
                This anchor binds the `x` position to the 
                &quot;left&quot;, &quot;center&quot; or &quot;right&quot; of the annotation. 
                For example, if `x` is set to 1, `xref` to 
                &quot;paper&quot; and `xanchor` to &quot;right&quot; then the 
                right-most portion of the annotation lines up 
                with the right-most edge of the plotting area. 
                If &quot;auto&quot;, the anchor is equivalent to &quot;center&quot; 
                for data-referenced annotations or if there is 
                an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no 
                arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the 
                closest side. 
            xshift 
                Shifts the position of the whole annotation and 
                arrow to the right (positive) or left 
                (negative) by this many pixels. 
            y 
                Sets the annotation's y position. 
            yanchor 
                Sets the text box's vertical position anchor 
                This anchor binds the `y` position to the 
                &quot;top&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; of the annotation. 
                For example, if `y` is set to 1, `yref` to 
                &quot;paper&quot; and `yanchor` to &quot;top&quot; then the top- 
                most portion of the annotation lines up with 
                the top-most edge of the plotting area. If 
                &quot;auto&quot;, the anchor is equivalent to &quot;middle&quot; 
                for data-referenced annotations or if there is 
                an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no 
                arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the 
                closest side. 
            yshift 
                Shifts the position of the whole annotation and 
                arrow up (positive) or down (negative) by this 
                many pixels. 
            z 
                Sets the annotation's z position.
