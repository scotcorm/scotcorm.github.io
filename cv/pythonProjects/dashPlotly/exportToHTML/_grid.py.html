            columns 
                The number of columns in the grid. If you 
                provide a 2D `subplots` array, the length of 
                its longest row is used as the default. If you 
                give an `xaxes` array, its length is used as 
                the default. But it's also possible to have a 
                different length, if you want to leave a row at 
                the end for non-cartesian subplots. 
            domain 
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.grid.Domain 
                ` instance or dict with compatible properties 
            pattern 
                If no `subplots`, `xaxes`, or `yaxes` are given 
                but we do have `rows` and `columns`, we can 
                generate defaults using consecutive axis IDs, 
                in two ways: &quot;coupled&quot; gives one x axis per 
                column and one y axis per row. &quot;independent&quot; 
                uses a new xy pair for each cell, left-to-right 
                across each row then iterating rows according 
                to `roworder`. 
            roworder 
                Is the first row the top or the bottom? Note 
                that columns are always enumerated from left to 
                right. 
            rows 
                The number of rows in the grid. If you provide 
                a 2D `subplots` array or a `yaxes` array, its 
                length is used as the default. But it's also 
                possible to have a different length, if you 
                want to leave a row at the end for non- 
                cartesian subplots. 
            subplots 
                Used for freeform grids, where some axes may be 
                shared across subplots but others are not. Each 
                entry should be a cartesian subplot id, like 
                &quot;xy&quot; or &quot;x3y2&quot;, or &quot;&quot; to leave that cell empty. 
                You may reuse x axes within the same column, 
                and y axes within the same row. Non-cartesian 
                subplots and traces that support `domain` can 
                place themselves in this grid separately using 
                the `gridcell` attribute. 
            xaxes 
                Used with `yaxes` when the x and y axes are 
                shared across columns and rows. Each entry 
                should be an x axis id like &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x2&quot;, etc., or 
                &quot;&quot; to not put an x axis in that column. Entries 
                other than &quot;&quot; must be unique. Ignored if 
                `subplots` is present. If missing but `yaxes` 
                is present, will generate consecutive IDs. 
            xgap 
                Horizontal space between grid cells, expressed 
                as a fraction of the total width available to 
                one cell. Defaults to 0.1 for coupled-axes 
                grids and 0.2 for independent grids. 
            xside 
                Sets where the x axis labels and titles go. 
                &quot;bottom&quot; means the very bottom of the grid. 
                &quot;bottom plot&quot; is the lowest plot that each x 
                axis is used in. &quot;top&quot; and &quot;top plot&quot; are 
                similar. 
            yaxes 
                Used with `yaxes` when the x and y axes are 
                shared across columns and rows. Each entry 
                should be an y axis id like &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;, etc., or 
                &quot;&quot; to not put a y axis in that row. Entries 
                other than &quot;&quot; must be unique. Ignored if 
                `subplots` is present. If missing but `xaxes` 
                is present, will generate consecutive IDs. 
            ygap 
                Vertical space between grid cells, expressed as 
                a fraction of the total height available to one 
                cell. Defaults to 0.1 for coupled-axes grids 
                and 0.3 for independent grids. 
            yside 
                Sets where the y axis labels and titles go. 
                &quot;left&quot; means the very left edge of the grid. 
                *left plot* is the leftmost plot that each y 
                axis is used in. &quot;right&quot; and *right plot* are 
                similar.
